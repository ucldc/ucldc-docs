Thanks for visiting our Documentation site. This page is under construction. Soon, we'll have some general information about the UCLDC technical model and major components illustrated below.

For now, we recommend you visit our [project wiki](https://wiki.library.ucsf.edu/display/UCLDC/Overview+of+UCLDC+Implementation) for general information about the UCLDC model and technical stack.

We have also recently drafted an <a href="http://ucldc.github.io/ucldc-docs/docs/dams/faq/">FAQ about the Shared DAMS</a>.

--there will be the latest diagram and some descriptive info here--

##Data storage
Data for all collections designated for public access—whether managed in the shared DAMS or in other platforms—is harvested by CDL and stored in the UCLDC common index. “Data” includes item-level metadata and references to access copies of files, stored by CDL for the optimal display of content in public access points (described below).

##Exposure to public access points
CDL exposes all of the data in the common index to three public access points:

- The common index API, which can be used to query and display the data in custom interfaces
- The new Calisphere website (beta version to be released in Summer 2015)
- The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) website and platform

##UCLDC Collection Administrators
UCLDC Collection Administrators perform administrative functions in the DAMS and Collection Registry on behalf of—and in close consultation with—their respective institutions. Specific responsibilities include:

- Authorizing users of the shared DAMS affiliated with their respective campus libraries
- Setting the appropriate permissions for shared DAMS users, using the Nuxeo interface
- Restricting access to their campuses’ resources in the shared DAMS (as necessary), using the Nuxeo interface
- Indicating which resources (if any) in the shared DAMS should be sent to Merritt for long-term preservation
- Authorizing editors of the Collection Registry (for adding and editing institution and collection data and harvest URLs)
- Indicating when their institutions’ collections are ready for harvest into the UCLDC common index
- Serving as first points of contact for CDL on issues and questions related to their respective institutions’ collections
