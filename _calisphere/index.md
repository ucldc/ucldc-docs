##What is the harvest?
The UCLDC platform is based on a harvesting system, which is used to import item-level metadata from a variety of systems into a Common Index. This allows for a single aggregation of data about and pointing to digital collections across California.

##Then what?
We are then exposing the data stored in the Common Index to three public access points:

- The Calisphere BETA website (coming late August 2015).
- The [Digital Public Library of America](http://dp.la/) website and platform.
- The [Common Index API]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/docs/technical/solr-api/), which can be used to query and display the data in custom interfaces.

##A note on timing
The UCLDC platform is currently under development. The project team is working with the UC campus libraries to conduct initial harvests; the first exposure of this data to the public access points is expected to occur in late August. At this time, therefore, this user guide describes the broad strokes of a process for the ongoing harvest and exposure of digital collections metadata. We will be adding more to this guide over the coming weeks, as we continue development and formalize processes. <i>- April 2015</i>

<!--Here is old Registry info:

Using the Digital Collection Registry
The Registry is an interface for campus library staff to manage and apply standardized information about campus units and digital collections that are published in Calisphere, and also to define and initiate metadata harvests for those collections. "Collections" may be defined in a few different ways. They may reside in the shared DAMS that is part of the UCLDC or they may be harvested from external sources (such as a campus OAI feed, the Internet Archive, or OAC/Calisphere) and brought into the UCLDC's central index.

The collection registry is an essential part of the UCLDC system with a few different use cases. Specifically, it handles the following functions:

- Serve as an authority file for collection and campus unit information.
- Provide campuses with a self-service dashboard for initiating metadata harvesting for collections.
- Drive some essential display requirements for the UCLDC public interface. For example, public interface end-users will be able to facet search results by campus unit.
- Enable campuses to denote and track the status of digital collections, for example indicating the location of collections ready for harvest.
- Provide a platform for collaborative digital collection development and/or digitization planning.
