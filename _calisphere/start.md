##Harvesting by Collection
Although we are harvesting item-level metadata into the UCLDC Common Index, our process for doing so is on a collection-by-collection basis. Collections are groups of digital objects which are hosted in the same source, can be harvested according to the same protocol, and which you'd like to appear together as a set within the Calisphere interface. 

You can define your collections in the [Collection Registry](http://registry.cdlib.org). To add or update information for your listings in the Collection Registry, please request changes <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ETVSMuRu1YlsDwp2iFRJTEp59ZulqvsoEoIcgJ09QZg/viewform">using this form</a>.

<div class="note"><p>The Collection Registry is an interface for content owners to define collections, specify the harvest targets and protocols for those collections, and apply standardized information about collections which will appear in the Calisphere interface. More documentation on the Registry is coming soon.</p></div>

##Role of Collection Administrator
In order to simplify procedures and ensure coordination between local and systemwide processes, each data provider must designate a [UCLDC Collection Administrator]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/collection-admins/). This person will be singularly responsible for initiating and managing harvests and communicating any key information to the CDL. Collection Administrators are assigned by the campus and/or institution. [Learn more.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/collection-admins/)

Once you have identified a collection(s) to be harvested by the UCLDC platform, please contact your [Collection Administrator.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/collection-admins/)

##Process
The process for initiating a harvest is as follows:

1. The Collection Administrator works with others on campus/at the institution to determine that a collection(s) of digital objects is ready for harvest and public access through the UCLDC platform, according to any local processes developed for decision-making.

2. The Collection Administrator notifies the CDL about which collection(s) should be harvested, and out of which platform. (Please note that this includes collections which are hosted in the UCLDC Shared DAMS.) At this time, we request simply that the Collection Administrator [send us an email notification](mailto:ucldc@ucop.edu).

3. CDL works with the Collection Administrator to establish the collection in the [Collection Registry](http://registry.cdlib.org). This includes basic information about the collection that will be used within the UCLDC public interface (e.g., title, description), as well as key information such as the method for harvesting the metadata.

##Avoiding redundant harvest
We are aware that some collections reside on multiple platforms. Most commonly, collections reside in both the OAC/Calisphere METS repository (which we are harvesting in its entirety) as well either the UCLDC Shared DAMS or a locally-managed solution.

You can decide which version of the collection you want to harvest into the platform. We can simply re-direct the harvest of a given collection to a different target (e.g. a campus DAMS). Once a campus/institution has determined the appropriate target for a collection, the Collection Administrator can contact us and indicate the new source and URL for harvesting. We will then work with the Administrator to harvest the collection from the preferred source.
