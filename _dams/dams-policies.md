title: Shared DAMS Policies
---

## Access to the DAMS
Only authorized users—UC Libraries staff, student workers, and other individuals expressly designated by the UC Libraries—may access the Shared DAMS. An account is necessary for accessing the system; once an account is obtained, a user can authenticate with his/her single sign-on credentials via Shibboleth. The creation of accounts are authorized by UCLDC Collection Administrators ([learn more]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/create-account/)).

By default, all folders in the shared DAMS and the digital resources and metadata within them are “read only,” meaning any DAMS user can view but not edit all content in the system. UCLDC Collection Administrators can manually restrict the viewing and editing of particular folders and items, as necessary.

## Criteria for collections
At this time, the UCLDC Shared DAMS is open only to digital content owned and/or stewarded by the UC Libraries. Otherwise, there are no criteria for inclusion; the DAMS is available for any unit within the Libraries to manage any content it deems necessary.

From a technical perspective, the Nuxeo platform may be better suited to some digital resources (for example, certain file types and formats) than others. See [Supported File Formats](http://doc.nuxeo.com/display/NXDOC/Supported+File+Formats) for the current version of Nuxeo supported by the CDL. In considering what to manage in the Shared DAMS, a further consideration may be the current access points supported by the UCLDC infrastructure (Calisphere, DPLA, and the Common Index API).

Campus partners are encouraged to <a href="mailto:ucldc@ucop.edu">contact the CDL's UCLDC team</a> about collections you are considering describing, storing, and/or managing using the shared DAMS.

## Metadata guidelines
The metadata scheme for the UCLDC Shared DAMS is available in the [DAMS user guide]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/dams/metadata-model/).

Metadata is not required for adding and managing resources in the DAMS, to allow content owners to safely and persistently store digital content with access restrictions and at all levels of "readiness." However, note that some metadata is required for providing public access to those resources, i.e. sending them for harvest into the UCLDC Common Index for dissemination. Please refer to the [UCLDC Metadata Harvesting Scheme](http://ucldc.github.io/ucldc-docs/docs/registry/metadata-harvest/) for these requirements.)
