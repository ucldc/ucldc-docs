All data harvested into the Common Index must adhere to the [UCLDC Metadata Harvesting Scheme and Crosswalk](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u2RE9PD0N9GkLQTFNJy3HiH9N5IbKDG52HjJ6JomC9I/edit#gid=265758929), which was adapted from the DPLA Metadata Application Profile.

##Required Metadata
***
<p>The following table summarizes data elements that must be present in each metadata record for harvest into the Common Index. Note that default values for <b>Type</b>, <b>Rights (Status)</b>, and <b>Rights (Statement)</b> can optionally be supplied and applied to individual metadata records at the time they are harvested, using the Collection Registry:</p>

* <a class="label">Title</a>
* <a class="label">Type</a>, based on <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/">DCMI Type Vocabulary</a>
* <a class="label">Rights Status</a> (public domain, copyrighted, copyright unknown)
* <a class="label">Rights Statement</a> (narrative statement that provides users with information about any copyright restrictions pertaining to use and re-use of the digital object)
* <a class="label">Is Shown At</a> (URL to a publicly-accessible view of the digital object)
* <a class="label">Object</a> (URL to a thumbnail image or service file suitable for public display, which can be used for display within the context of Calisphere and DPLA object views and search/browse results)
